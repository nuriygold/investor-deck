## Key Strategic Framing

### What Changed (v4.0 Update)

This deck reflects feedback from **Valor Ventures** (February 20, 2026) and repositions Nuriy from marketplace-first to infrastructure-first:

| Old Framing | New Framing |
|-------------|-------------|
| Sustainable jewelry marketplace | Verification infrastructure for supply chain compliance |
| Conscious consumers want ethical options | Brands legally required to verify supply chains by 2027 |
| Marketplace commissions drive revenue | B2B SaaS subscriptions and certification licensing |
| Consumer acquisition strategy | B2B compliance buyer strategy |
| Jewelry-focused business | Jewelry beachhead, category expansion vision |
| Nuriy Score as product feature | Nuriy Score as industry certification standard |

### Investor Framing

> "This is compliance-driven, non-discretionary B2B software — brands buy because lawyers and regulators require it, not sentiment."

### The LEED Model

Nuriy is building certification standard infrastructure:
- Products earn Nuriy Score
- Brands license and display the label
- Consumers demand it
- **Nuriy owns the infrastructure underneath**
